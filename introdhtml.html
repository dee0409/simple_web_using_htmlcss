<header><h1>What is HTML?</h1></header>
<p><b>HTML</b> is an acronym which stands for <i>Hyper Text Markup Language</i> which is used for creating web pages and web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.</p>
<ol><li>
<b>Hyper Text</b>: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.</li>

<li><b>Markup language</b>: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.</li>


<li><b>Web Page</b>: A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.</li></ol>

<p>Hence, HTML is a markup language which is used for creating attractive web pages with the help of styling, and which looks in a nice format on a web browser. An HTML document is made of many HTML tags and each HTML tag contains different content.</p>

<h1>Brief History of HTML</h1>
<p>In the late 1980's , a physicist, Tim Berners-Lee who was a contractor at CERN, proposed a system for CERN researchers. In 1989, he wrote a memo proposing an internet based hypertext system.</p>

<li><i>Tim Berners-Lee</i> is known as the father of HTML. The first available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags" proposed by Tim in late 1991. The latest version of HTML is HTML5, which we will learn later in this tutorial.</li>

<h1>HTML Versions</h1>
<p>Since the time HTML was invented there are lots of HTML versions in market, the brief introduction about the HTML version is given below:</p>

<li><b>HTML 3.2</b>: HTML 3.2 version was published by W3C in early 1997. This version was capable of creating tables and providing support for extra options for form elements. It can also support a web page with complex mathematical equations. It became an official standard for any browser till January 1997. Today it is practically supported by most of the browsers.</li>
